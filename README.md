First time doing everything with Webpack. 

This is my first project that is up on github pages! I was so happy and excited to learn that this could be done! Just by making a gh-pages branch, I changed my to default branch. Now live [here](http://natac13.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game/)

## Setup

```
npm install
npm start
```

### testing with mocha 

```
npm test
```
